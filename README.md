# Chat Socket
This is a simple project where i use python socketserver and socket libraries to create a live chat room

# How to use
Simple run server.py first, then the clients

# New things to be added
Allowing the user to fill in a config file for password and if encryption should be turned on
Also the server owner should be able to create his/her own commands which will echo data back to the client
